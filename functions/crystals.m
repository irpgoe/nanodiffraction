%   [RESULT] = GET_INDEX(DATA,MASK,SEL,THRESHOLD)
%
%   The following arguments are required:
%       DATA:: ()
%           Data (2d array).
%
%       MASK:: ()
%           Bad pixels.
%
%       SEL:: ()
%           Good pixels.
%
%       THRESHOLD:: ()
%           Maximal qr value to be taken into account.
