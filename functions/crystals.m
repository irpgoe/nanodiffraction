function [result] = crystals(data,mask,sel,threshold)    
% CRYSTAL  Calculates the signal-to-noise ratio and calculates the integrated intensity for data above a given threshold
%
%   ``[result] = crystals(data,mask,sel,threshold)``
%
% Parameters
% ----------
% data: Two-dimensional numeric array
%   Diffraction pattern
%
% mask: logical array, default = []
%   Logical array of the size of the input data that defines which pixels are considered bad (1 = bad, 0 = valid)
%
% selection: logical array, default = []
%   Logical array of the size of the input data that defines which pixels should be analyzed (1 = valid, 0 = invalid)
%
% threshold: numeric value
%   Data above which the scattered intensity should be integrated
%
% Returns
% -------
% result: Numeric value
%   Integrated intensity of scattered intensity of all valid data points above the given threshold
