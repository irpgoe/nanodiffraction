function [circMean, circVar] = circular_dist(phi,I)
    % CIRCULAR_DIST  Calculates the circular mean and variance of a 
    % distribution based on 
    % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_statistics
    %
    %   [circMean, circVar] = circular_dist(phi,I)
    %
    % The following arguments are supported:
    %     phi:: [] (required)
    %       phi usually within the range [-180, 180] (because of central symmetry)
    %
    %     I:: [] (required)
    %       I is usually given in counts
    %
    % Example:
    %   Example missing.
    %
    % Output arguments:
    %   circMean:: Circular mean.
    %
    %   circVar:: Circular variance.
