function [circMean, circVar] = circular_dist(phi,I)
% CIRCULAR_DIST  Calculates the circular mean and variance of a 
% distribution based on 
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_statistics
%
%   ``[circMean, circVar] = circular_dist(phi,I)``
%
% In a principal component analysis of a scattering distribution, the covariance matrix of the
% distribution is calculated and orthogonalized. The procedure is described in more detail in
% Bernhardt et al., 2016.
%
% Parameters
% ----------
% phi: One-dimensional numeric array
%   phi contains angles within the range [-180, 180]
%
% I: One-dimensional numeric array
%   Intensity as a function of the azimuthal angle phi
%
% Returns
% -------
% circMean: Numeric value
%   The circular mean of the distribution
%
% circVar: Numeric value
%   The circular variance of the distribution
%
% Notes
% -----
% Example 1:
%
% .. code-block:: matlab
%
%       e = nanodiffraction();
%       streak = e.simulate_streak();
%       [phi,I] = split_struct(b1d(streak,[],[],e.phi,360),{'x','y'});
%       [circMean, circVar] = circular_dist(phi,I);
