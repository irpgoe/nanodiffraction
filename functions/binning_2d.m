function image = binning_2d(image,binx,biny)                
% BINNING_2D  bins and image according to the binning
% factors binx and biny.
%
%   ``BINNED_IMAGE = BINNING_2D(IMAGE, BINX, BINY)``
%
% Parameters
% ----------
%   image: Two-dimensional numeric array
%       Input image
%
%   binx: Integer
%       Integer binning factor along the horizontal dimension
%
%   biny: Integer
%       Integer binning factor along the vertical dimension
%
% Returns
% -------
%   binned_image: Two-dimensional numeric array
%       Image binned by the binning factors binx and biny
%
% Notes
% -----
% Example 1:   
%
% .. code-block:: matlab
%
%   testimage = magic(256);
%   binned_im = binning_2d(testimage,2,2);
