function [varargout] = split_struct(struct_name, arglist)
% SPLIT_STRUCT  Returns each indicated field as a separate variable.
%   
%   ``result = split_struct(structure, cell_array_of_arguments)``
%
% 
%
% Parameters
% ----------
%   structure: Structure
%       A structure that contains any number of fields. It can also be a nested structure
%
%   cell_array_of_arguments: Cell array
%       A cell array of field names. Each field name will be searched in the (possibly nested) structure. 
%       If a field name was found in the structure, it is added to the output argument list. 
%
% Returns
% -------
%   Variable-length output argument list. The length of the list is given by the number of fields that matched a query field name.
%
% Notes
% -----
% Example 1:
%
% .. code-block:: matlab
%
%       test_structure = struct('w',magic(25),'angle',pi/6);
%       [w,angle] = split_struct(test_structure,{'w','angle'});
%
% Example 2:
%
% .. code-block:: matlab
%
%       test_structure = struct('w', magic(25), 'angle', pi/6, struct('power', 2^3, 'prime', 13));
%       [w,angle,prime] = split_struct(test_structure,{'w','angle','prime'});
