function [results] = b1d(dat,mask,sel,grid,varargin)
% B1D  performs an angular average based on histogramming the intensity of
% each pixel in a certain radial interval. B1D stands for *binning 1D* and
% is considered to be a rather simple but fast method to get accurate
% angular averages.
%   
%   result = b1d(data,mask,selection,grid,bins) 
%
% The following arguments are supported:
%     data:: [] (required)
%       The data that will be processed.
%
%     mask:: [] (required)
%       A logical mask that identifies all values that should not be taken 
%       into account during rebinning.
%
%     selection:: [] (required)
%       A logical array that selects all pixels that should be taken into
%       account. A pixel is taken into account if it is identified in the
%       selection as 1.
%
%     grid:: [] (required)
%       Usually, Qr is expected to be used, however, any radial grid can be
%       used here.
%
%     bins:: [360] (optional)
%       Number of bins.
%
% Example:
%   testavg = b1d(2d_diffraction_pattern,detector_mask,[],qr_map,512);
%
% Output arguments:
%   result:: Structure than contains the following fields:
%
%       - dat_1d:: One-dimensinoal azimuthally integrated data.
%
%       - qr:: X-axis, dependent on the grid used, however, it is usually
%       expected in units of the reciprocal wavevector qr (inv. nanometers)
%       and hence named qr.
%
%       - y:: A short-hand for dat_1d.
%
%    	- x:: A short-hand for qr. Also, independent of a specified grid.
%
%       - error:: Propagated measurement error.
