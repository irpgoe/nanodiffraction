function [results] = b1d(dat,mask,sel,grid,varargin)
% B1D  performs an angular average based on histogramming the intensity of
% each pixel in a certain radial interval. b1d is short for one-dimensional binning and
% is considered to be a rather simple but fast method to get accurate
% angular averages.
%   
%   ``result = b1d(data,mask,selection,grid,bins)``
%
% Parameters
% ----------
%   data: Two-dimensional numeric array
%       Diffraction pattern
%
%   mask: logical array, default = []
%       Logical array of the size of the input data that defines which pixels are considered bad (1 = bad, 0 = valid)
%
%   selection: logical array, default = []
%       Logical array of the size of the input data that defines which pixels should be analyzed (1 = valid, 0 = invalid)
%
%   grid: Two-dimensional numeric array
%       Usually, the radial wavevector transfer is expected to be used, however, any radially symmetric grid can be
%       used here
%
%   bins: Numeric value, default = 360, optional
%       Number of bins used for histogramming
%
% Returns
% -------
%   result: structure
%       Structure with the following fields:
%
%       - dat_1d: One-dimensional azimuthally integrated data
%       - qr: X-axis, dependent on the grid used, however, it is usually
%       expected in units of the reciprocal wavevector qr (inv. nanometers)
%       and hence named qr
%       - y: A short-hand for dat_1d
%    	- x: A short-hand for qr. Also, independent of a specified grid
%       - error: Propagated measurement error, calculated from the square
%       root of the average intensity I, divided by the square root of the
%       number of data points n averaged in each bin: sqrt(I)/sqrt(n)
%       [point-wise division]
%
% Notes
% -----
% Example 1:
%
% .. code-block:: matlab
%
%   e = nanodiffraction();
%   testdata = e.qr;
%   testavg = b1d(testdata,[],[],e.qr,512);
