function result = stxm(data,mask,sel)
% STXM  Integrated the intensity in a diffraction pattern or part of a diffraction pattern
%
%   ``result = stxm(data,mask,selection)``
%
% Parameters
% ----------
%   data: two-dimensional numeric array 
%       A diffraction pattern 
%
%   mask: logical array, default = []
%       Logical array of the size of the input data that defines which pixels are considered bad (1 = bad, 0 = valid)
%
%   selection: logical array, default = []
%       Logical array of the size of the input data that defines which pixels should be analyzed (1 = valid, 0 = invalid)
%
% Returns
% -------
%   result: Double 
%       The integrated intensity of data within a given selection and without masked pixels
%
% Notes
% -----
% Example 1:
%   
% .. code-block:: matlab
%
%   stxm_result = stxm(data,[],[]);
