function result = stxm(data,mask,sel)
% STXM  Sums a 2d array. In addition, it takes into
% account a minimum and maximum q_r value for integration
%
%   result = stxm(data,mask,selection)
%
% The following arguments are supported:
%       data:: [] (required) 
%           A two-dimensional diffraction pattern. 
%
%       mask:: [] (required)
%           Mask that defines which pixels are bad and should not be taken
%           into account. The mask can be an empty matrix. In this case, it
%           is assumed that all pixels are valid. The dimensions of mask
%           have to match the size of data.
%
%       selection:: [] (required)
%           Data selection, defines which pixels should be taken into
%           account. The selection can be an empty matrix. In this case, it
%           is assumed that all pixels should be selected. The dimensions
%           of mask have to match the size of data.
%
% Example:
%   stxm_result = stxm(a_2d_diffraction_pattern,mask,[]);
%
% Output arguments:
%   result:: The integrated intensity of data.
