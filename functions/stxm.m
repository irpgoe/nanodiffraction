function result = stxm(data,mask,sel)
% STXM  Sums a 2d array. In addition, it takes into
% account a minimum and maximum q_r value for integration
%
%   RESULT = STXM(DATA,MASK,SEL)
%
%   The following arguments are required:
%       DAT:: ()
%           Diffraction pattern.
%
%       MASK:: ()
%           Mask that defines which pixels are bad and should be ignored.
%
%       SEL:: ()
%           Data selection, defines which pixels should be taken into account.
