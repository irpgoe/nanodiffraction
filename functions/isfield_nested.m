function [isFieldResult,val] = isfield_nested(inStruct, fieldName)
% ISFIELD_NESTED checks wether a field exists within a structure
%
%   ``[isField,value] = isfield_nested(inStruct, fieldName)
%
% Parameters
% ----------
%   inStruct: Structure or structure array
%       The name of the structure or an array of structures to search
%
%   fieldName: String 
%       The name of the field for which the function searches
%
% Returns
% -------
%   isField: boolean
%       Boolean value; true = field exists, false = field does not exist
%
%   value: numeric
%       Value of the identified field. If field was not found inside the structure, a value of NaN is returned.
