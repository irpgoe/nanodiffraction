function [dpcy, dpcz] = center_of_mass(data)
% CENTER_OF_MASS calculates the center of mass of a diffraction pattern.
% This is commonly used for experiments without beamstop where only the
% shift of the center of mass of the primary beam due to refraction of the
% beam is recorded. When applied in a raster-scan experiment, one obtains a
% differential phase contrast image of the sample.

%   ``[dpcy, dpcz] = center_of_mass(data)``
