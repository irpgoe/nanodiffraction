function [results] = b1d_fast(dat,mask,sel,sortIndex,n,bin)
% B1D_FAST  performs an angular average based on histogramming the intensity of
% each pixel in a certain radial interval. b1d is short for one-dimensional binning and
% is considered to be a rather simple but fast method to get accurate
% angular averages. B1D_FAST is used in batch processing of files and based
% on the method B1D, however, it avoids the repeated calculation of how
% many detector pixels belong into one q-bin. Instead, this needs to be
% calculated beforehand and passed to B1D_FAST.
%   
%   ``result = b1d_fast(data,mask,selection,sortIndex,n,bin)``
%
% Parameters
% ----------
%   data: Two-dimensional numeric array
%       Diffraction pattern
%
%   mask: logical array, default = []
%       Logical array of the size of the input data that defines which pixels are considered bad (1 = bad, 0 = valid)
%
%   selection: logical array, default = []
%       Logical array of the size of the input data that defines which pixels should be analyzed (1 = valid, 0 = invalid)
%
%   sortIndex: One-dimensional numeric array
%       Contains the indices of the q-bins for each detector pixel
%
%   n: One-dimensional numeric array
%       Contains the number of pixels that belong to each q-bin
%
%   bin: One-dimensional numeric array
%       bin index
%
% Returns
% -------
%   result: structure
%       Structure with the following fields:
%
%       - dat_1d: One-dimensional azimuthally integrated data
%       - y: A short-hand for dat_1d
%       - error: Propagated measurement error, calculated from the square
%       root of the average intensity I, divided by the square root of the
%       number of data points n averaged in each bin: sqrt(I)/sqrt(n)
%       [point-wise division]
%
% Notes
% -----
% Example 1:
%
% .. code-block:: matlab
%
%   e = nanodiffraction();
%   testdata = e.qr;
%   [x,sortIndex,n,bin] = b1d_init(grid,mask,sel,bins)
%   testavg = b1d(testdata,[],[],sortIndex,n,bin);
