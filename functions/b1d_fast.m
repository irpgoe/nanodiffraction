function [results] = b1d_fast(dat,mask,sel,sortIndex,n,bin)
% B1D  performs an angular average based on histogramming the intensity of
% each pixel in a certain radial interval. B1D stands for *binning 1D* and
% is considered to be a rather simple but fast method to get accurate
% angular averages.
%   
%   [RESULT] = B1D(DATA,MASK,SEL,GRID,BINS) 
%
%   The following options are required:
%
%     DATA::
%       The data that will be processed.
%
%     MASK::
%       A logical sel that sets all values that should not be taken into
%       account to NaN
%
%     SEL::
%       A logical sel that selects all pixels that should be taken into
%       account 
%
%     GRID::
%       Usually, Qr is expected to be used, however, any radial grid can be
%       used here.
%
%   The following options are optional:
%
%     BINS:: (360)
%       Number of bins.
