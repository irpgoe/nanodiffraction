Documentation of the nanodiffraction toolbox
============================================

The nanodiffraction toolbox is a set of Matlab classes and functions used for the analysis of scattering and diffraction data. It is primarily suited for the batch analysis of small-angle scattering data obtained in scanning experiments. It's main purpose is also described in [Nicolas2017a]_.
